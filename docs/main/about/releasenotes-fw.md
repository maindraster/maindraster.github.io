# Release Notes

## BioNeMo Framework v2.7

### Updates & Improvements

- Evo2 model improvements:

  - Context, tensor and data parallelism support in the prediction endpoint as well as support for context lengths over 8192 https://github.com/NVIDIA/bionemo-framework/pull/1123. Fixes https://github.com/NVIDIA/bionemo-framework/issues/910 and https://github.com/NVIDIA/bionemo-framework/issues/1048.

  - LoRA fine-tuning by @gabenavarro: https://github.com/NVIDIA/bionemo-framework/pull/980. Note: internal CI coverage of LoRA convergence is still a work in progress; therefore, we cannot guarantee convergence.

  - Fix a 2x memory-usage issue during Evo2 generation: https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo/pull/14515

  - Add flash-decode support in inference: https://github.com/NVIDIA/bionemo-framework/pull/1000

  - Update Rotary Embedding and sequence-length defaults to address incorrect checkpoint conversion: https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo/pull/14514

  - Improvements to tag masking in the Evo2 loss: https://github.com/NVIDIA/bionemo-framework/pull/1008

  - Support for [Spike-no-more](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16903) to improve training stability: https://github.com/NVIDIA/bionemo-framework/pull/1011

- Added a header to SCDL archives, providing improved provenance tracking and supporting future releases. It also adds tracking of AnnData API coverage in SCDL tests.
  This header stores metadata about the archive and its composite arrays, including a version; the array lengths and data types; and information about the RowFeatureIndexes. This adds the features necessary to fix https://github.com/NVIDIA/bionemo-framework/issues/999 as well as to implement simple bit-packing of the rowptr, colptr, and data arrays. It should also make SCDL more secure, enable strict compatibility checking, and open the door to further performance improvements: https://github.com/NVIDIA/bionemo-framework/pull/1030

- `bionemo-geometric` has been deprecated and removed. The molecular-featurization tooling in this package has moved to [cuik-molmaker](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Digital-Bio/cuik-molmaker).

### Known Issues

- We have removed `libtiff` from the container due to a known vulnerability, [CVE-2025-9900](https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2025-9900). `libtiff` isn't directly used in any BioNeMo code; however, users might face issues with e.g. Pillow or other common image-manipulation libraries inside this container.

## BioNeMo Framework v2.0

### New Features:

- ESM-2 implementation
  - State of the art training performance and equivalent accuracy to the reference implementation
  - 650M, and 3B scale checkpoints available which mirror the reference model
  - Flexible fine-tuning examples that can be copied and modified to accomplish a wide variety of downstream tasks
- First version of our NeMo v2 based reference implementation which re-imagines bionemo as a repository of megatron models, dataloaders, and training recipes which make use of NeMo v2 for training loops.
  - Modular design and permissible Apache 2 OSS licenses enables the import and use of our framework in proprietary applications.
  - NeMo2 training abstractions allows the user to focus on the model implementation while the training strategy handles distribution and model parallelism.
- Documentation and documentation build system for BioNeMo 2.

### Known Issues:

- PEFT support is not yet fully functional.
- Partial implementation of Geneformer is present, use at your own risk. It will be optimized and officially released in the future.
- Command line interface is currently based on one-off training recipes and scripts. We are working on a configuration based approach that will be released in the future.
- Fine-tuning workflow is implemented for BERT based architectures and could be adapted for others, but it requires you to inherit from the biobert base model config. You can follow similar patterns in the short term to load weights from an old checkpoint partially into a new model, however in the future we will have a more direct API which is easier to follow.
- Slow memory leak occurs during ESM-2 pretraining, which can cause OOM during long pretraining runs. Training with a
  microbatch size of 48 on 40 A100s raised an out-of-memory error after 5,800 training steps.
  - Possible workarounds include calling `gc.collect(); torch.cuda.empty_cache()` at every ~1,000 steps, which appears
    to reclaim the consumed memory; or training with a lower microbatch size and re-starting training from a saved
    checkpoint periodically.

We do not use that package in bionemo framework container. we are also unable to remove the package in question as it's installed as a side-effect of installing lightning.
- Two known High CVEs from pytorch : GHSA-pg7h-5qx3-wjr3, GHSA-5pcm-hx3q-hm94.

## BioNeMo Framework v1.7

### New Models

BioNeMo itself does not use this dependency in any way, however parts of NeMo text-to-speech (nemo.collections.tts) does use this vulnerable codepath. Since NeMo is installed in the BioNeMo release containers, users are urged to exercise caution when using nemo.collections.tts or nltk.

## BioNeMo Framework v1.6

  the NGC CLI will be auto-installed to pull the models from NGC.

### Known Issues

- BioNeMo Framework v24.03 container is vulnerable to [GHSA-whh8-fjgc-qp73](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-whh8-fjgc-qp73) in onnx 1.14.0. Users are advised not to open untrusted onnx files with this image. Restrict your mount point to minimize directory traversal impact.

The user may set `config.model.data.default_dataset_path` to maintain prior behavior, or set `config.model.data.train.dataset_path`, `config.model.data.val.dataset_path`, `config.model.data.test.dataset_path` which may all be unique.

### Known Issues

- OpenFold training speed does not yet include [MLPerf optimizations](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/scaling-ai-training-mlperf/), and these will be released in the subsequent release.

- Refactor of download_models.sh to download_models.py for easier CLI use.
- Refactor of install structure to move from /opt/nvidia to /workspace/bionemo. The environment variable $BIONEMO_HOME now points to the repo base and is required to be set for tests to pass.

### Security Notice

SchedMD Slurm in the release container is shipped with a security vulnerability, [CVE-2022-29501](https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2022-29501), and therefore this version of Slurm should not be used to run a Slurm cluster (specifically, the processes `slurmdbd`, `slurmctld`, and `slurmd`.

In general, the BioNeMo Framework release is designed to ship code and an environment that would be executed on local workstations, or deployed on clusters for large scale training jobs. This container is not designed to run as a service with public facing APIs. A full summary of security vulnerabilities can be found [here](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/clara/containers/bionemo-framework/security).
